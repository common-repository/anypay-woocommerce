== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Can I use this plugin to accept payments on my WordPress site in multiple different cryptocurrencies?

A: Yes.

What is the cost?

A: The app is free to download. Payments are direct from customer's wallet to merchant's wallet. All payments are "multi-output" meaning they are split. 99.9% of a payment goes to the merchant.
